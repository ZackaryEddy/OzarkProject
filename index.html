Check the weather forecast before you leave and pack appropriate clothes such as drying shorts, a hat, rain jacket				and anything else you’ll need if the weather turns stormy. </h4>			<h3>Sunblock and insect repellant</h3>			<h4>The sun can get intense on the Buffalo River, so be sure to pack plenty of waterproof sunscreen and a hat to make sure				you protect your skin against harmful UV rays. This helps prevent both sunburn and dehydration. Insect repellent will also				keep at bay the mosquitos and flies, which can be extremely annoying when you’re trying to enjoy your day trip.				<h3>First Aid Kit</h3>				<h4>Even though you embark on your journey with hopes of long lasting memories, accidents and injuries are still possible. You or					members of your party could slip on rocks, overturn a canoe, get stung by a bee or suffer any number of injuries while out on the					Buffalo River. To that end, you should bring with you a basic First Aid kit, complete with bandages, antiseptic and antibiotic cream,					along with any medications you or others may need.					<h3>Food and Drinks</h3>					<h4>Although you may only plan on being on the river for a few hours, be sure to prepare enough food to last you for a couple of meals						in case an emergency arises. Packing a little more food won’t take up a lot of extra room, but could come in very handy if your trip lasts						longer than originally expected due to delays.						<h3>Map / GPS unit</h3>						<h4>Someone in your party and ideally more than one person should know exactly where you’re going and how to spot your takeout point. Have							a map handy with the point clearly marked, and pack a waterproof flashlight and compass just in case you need to navigate past dusk.							Before heading out, decide where you want to go, what you should bring and any resources or supplies you might need from . Then, stick							to your plan and locate your takeout point and try not to improvise too much while out on the river.</h4>						<img src = https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3G8-woXEAIm_p9.jpg alt = "floating" width="100%" </img>		</div>	</main>	<footer>		<p align = "center">Contact information </br>			<a>Telephone: (407)-254-1299</a></br>Email:			<a href="Jim.Brown1013@WildRiverRapids.com">				Jim.Brown1013@WildRiverRapids.com			</a>		</p>	</footer></body></html>
